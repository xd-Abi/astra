# Deploying a Next.js App with Vercel

## Step 1: Install Required Tools

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Install the Next.js CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g create-next-app
```

## Step 2: Create a Next.js App

Create a new Next.js app:

```bash
npx create-next-app your-app-name
```

Replace `your-app-name` with your desired app name.

## Step 3: Navigate to the Project Directory

```bash
cd your-app-name
```

## Step 4: Create a Vercel Account

If you don't have one, sign up at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/).

## Step 5: Install Vercel CLI

Install the Vercel CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

## Step 6: Log in to Vercel

```bash
vercel login
```

## Step 7: Deploy the App

```bash
vercel
```

Follow the prompts during the deployment process.

## Step 8: Set Up Environment Variables

If your app uses environment variables, set them up in the Vercel dashboard under "Settings."

## Step 9: Access Your Deployed App

Once deployed, Vercel will provide a unique URL for your app.

Congratulations! Your Next.js app is deployed on Vercel.
