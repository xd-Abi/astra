# Naming Conventions

In order to maintain consistency and enhance code readability, the following naming conventions are encouraged:

- **UpperCamelCase:**
  - Applied to Classes, Enumerations, and Typedefs.
  - 
    ```cpp
    // Good
    class MyClass {
      // class implementation
    }

    // Bad
    class myClass {
      // class implementation
    }
    ```

- **snake_case:**
  - Applied to Libraries, packages, directories, and file names.
  - 
    ```python
    # Good
    import my_library
    from my_package import my_module

    # Bad
    import MyLibrary
    from MyPackage import MyModule
    ```

- **lowerCamelCase:**
  - Applied to Variables, constants, and parameters.
  - 
    ```java
    // Good
    int myVariable = 42;
    final int myConstant = 10;

    // Bad
    int MyVariable = 42;
    final int MyConstant = 10;
    ```

By adhering to these naming conventions, we create a codebase that is not only consistent but also promotes clarity and understanding for all team members.
